# The Misadventures of Mr.Block
This project originated as a course assignment for a mobile development class I took in school, and is now a personal project that I work on in my spare time. The game is an endless runner that features a grappling hook mechanic for movement, the name of the game is last as long as possible, the longer you survive the higher your score. Swing and dash your way around spinning blades that will saw you in half, through deadly pistons that will squish you flat, and many more deadly obstacles in The Misadventures of Mr.Block.
