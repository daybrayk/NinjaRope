# The Misadventures of Mr.Block
This project originated as a course assignment for a mobile development class I took in school, and is now a personal project that I work on in my spare time. The game is an endless runner that features a grappling hook mechanic for movement, the name of the game is last as long as possible, the longer you survive the higher your score. Swing and dash your way around spinning blades that will saw you in half, through deadly pistons that will squish you flat, and many more deadly obstacles in The Misadventures of Mr.Block.

# Roadmap
The current stage of the game is very minimal, there is still a lot of work to be done. Here is a general idea of what is to come as I continue to work on the game, in no particular order:

**Smoother Movement** - Currently the movement in the game feels floaty and fast, when you release from your grappling hook you can travel incredibly far before you start to fall, because of this it makes the grappling hook mechanic feel tricky to use. I have plans on adjusting the gravity settings to make it feel less floaty, as well as adjusting the characters velocity so there is a smoother transition into the rope swing.

**Currency** - Currently there is no form of currency to be gained as you play the game, and without currency there can be no purchasable items. In time both of these will be integrated into the game but the first task is to design a currency system.

**Artwork** - Everything currently in the game is temporary as I just needed placeholder objects for the class assignment. Also I am no artist so placeholder objects is the best I could hope for. I do have an artist creating assets for me, so as I receive them they will be placed into the game.
